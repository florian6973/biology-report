  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vaccination constitutes a major advance in the prevention of infectious diseases. The principle of vaccination is to induce protection against a pathogen by mimicking its natural interaction with the human immune system. The vaccine reduces the risk of complications and mortality following subsequent exposure to an infectious agent. STATE OF THE ART: In this review we recall the history of vaccination as well as the basic immunological principles underlying the composition of vaccines and the response to vaccination. In this way, vaccines induce the immune system to produce an immunological memory based on T and B lymphocytes in order to produce a rapid and effective response to exposure to the targeted pathogen. OUTLOOK: The improvement of existing vaccines and the discovery of new vaccines requires an understanding of the immunological principles of vaccination. Great challenges remain, particularly in terms of target pathogens for future vaccine candidates and also the acceptance of vaccination. CONCLUSION: Understanding the principles of vaccination allows development of vaccines and the control of infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Coronavirus outbreak 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all the corners of the globe and created chaos to human life. In order to put some control on the pandemic, vaccines are urgently required that are safe, cost effective, easy to produce, and most importantly induce appropriate immune responses and protection against viral infection. DNA vaccines possess all these features and are promising candidates for providing protection against SARS-CoV-2.Area covered: Current understanding and advances in DNA vaccines toward COVID-19, especially those under various stages of clinical trials.Expert opinion: Through DNA vaccines, host cells are momentarily transformed into factories that produce proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. The host immune system detects these proteins to develop antibodies that neutralize and prevent the infection. This vaccine platform has additional benefits compared to traditional vaccination strategies like strong cellular immune response, higher safety margin, a simple production process as per cGMP norms, lack of any infectious agent, and a robust platform for large-scale production.},

  abstract = {The vaccines developed over the first two hundred years since Jenner's lifetime have accomplished striking reductions of infection and disease wherever applied. Pasteur's early approaches to vaccine development, attenuation and inactivation, are even now the two poles of vaccine technology. Today, purification of microbial elements, genetic engineering and improved knowledge of immune protection allow direct creation of attenuated mutants, expression of vaccine proteins in live vectors, purification and even synthesis of microbial antigens, and induction of a variety of immune responses through manipulation of DNA, RNA, proteins and polysaccharides. Both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology. The profusion of new vaccines enables new populations to be targeted for vaccination, and requires the development of routes of administration additional to injection. With all this come new problems in the production, regulation and distribution of vaccines.},

Fortunately, new technologies, the pace of understanding new and existing pathogens, and the increased knowledge of the immune system allow us today to develop vaccines at an unprecedented speed. Some of the vaccine technologies that are fast-tracked by the urgency of COVID-19 may also be the answer for other health priorities, such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic infections, and cancer, that the post-COVID-19 world will urgently need to face. This perspective analyzes the way COVID-19 is transforming vaccinology and the opportunities for vaccines to have an increasingly important role in health and well-being.},

  abstract = {mRNA vaccines combine desirable immunological properties with an outstanding safety profile and the unmet flexibility of genetic vaccines. Based on in situ protein expression, mRNA vaccines are capable of inducing a balanced immune response comprising both cellular and humoral immunity while not subject to MHC haplotype restriction. In addition, mRNA is an intrinsically safe vector as it is a minimal and only transient carrier of information that does not interact with the genome. Because any protein can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process, mRNA vaccines also offer maximum flexibility with respect to development. Taken together, mRNA presents a promising vector that may well become the basis of a game-changing vaccine technology platform. Here, we outline the current knowledge regarding different aspects that should be considered when developing an mRNA-based vaccine technology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In 2019, a new coronavirus has been identified and many efforts have been directed toward the development of effective vaccines. However, the willingness for vaccination is deeply influenced by several factors. So the aim of our review was to analyze the theme of vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on vaccine hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccine. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: In November 2020, we performed a search for original peer-reviewed articles in the electronic database PubMed (MEDLINE). The key search terms were "Vaccine hesitancy AND COVID-19". We searched for studies published during COVID-19 pandemic and reporting information about the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review. The percentage of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was not so high (up to 86.1\% students or 77.6\% general population); for influenza vaccine, the maximum percentage was 69\%. Several factors influenced the acceptance or refusal (ethnicity, working status, religiosity, politics, gender, age, education, income, etc.). The most given reasons to refuse vaccine were as follows: being against vaccines in general, concerns about safety/thinking that a vaccine produced in a rush is too dangerous, considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless nature of COVID-19, general lack of trust, doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine, belief to be already immunized, doubt about the provenience of vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The high vaccine hesitancy, also during COVID-19 pandemic, represents an important problem, and further efforts should be done to support people and give them correct information about vaccines.},
