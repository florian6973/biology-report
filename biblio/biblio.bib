  abstract = {RNA sequences encoding the surface projection (spike) of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, strain Beaudette, have been cloned into pBR322 using cDNA primed with a specific oligonucleotide. A 5.3 kilobase viral insert in the clone pMB179 has been identified. The region of this clone coding for the spike gene has been sequenced by the chain termination method, and we present here the first report of DNA sequence data for a coronavirus spike protein, the protein which forms the characteristic 'corona' after which the group is named. The amino acid sequence of the primary translation product, deduced from the DNA sequence, predicts a polypeptide of 1162 amino acids with a molecular weight of 127 006. This has many interesting features which confirm and extend our knowledge of this recently characterized membrane glycoprotein. The polypeptide is subsequently cleaved to S1 and S2, and partial amino acid analysis of the amino-terminus of the S1 polypeptide has been employed to locate the position of this terminus of S1 within the large open reading frame. The amino acid analysis also reveals the presence of an 18 amino acid putative signal sequence on the primary translation product which is not present on the mature S1 polypeptide.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vaccination constitutes a major advance in the prevention of infectious diseases. The principle of vaccination is to induce protection against a pathogen by mimicking its natural interaction with the human immune system. The vaccine reduces the risk of complications and mortality following subsequent exposure to an infectious agent. STATE OF THE ART: In this review we recall the history of vaccination as well as the basic immunological principles underlying the composition of vaccines and the response to vaccination. In this way, vaccines induce the immune system to produce an immunological memory based on T and B lymphocytes in order to produce a rapid and effective response to exposure to the targeted pathogen. OUTLOOK: The improvement of existing vaccines and the discovery of new vaccines requires an understanding of the immunological principles of vaccination. Great challenges remain, particularly in terms of target pathogens for future vaccine candidates and also the acceptance of vaccination. CONCLUSION: Understanding the principles of vaccination allows development of vaccines and the control of infectious diseases.},

In order to put some control on the pandemic, vaccines are urgently required that are safe, cost effective, easy to produce, and most importantly induce appropriate immune responses and protection against viral infection. DNA vaccines possess all these features and are promising candidates for providing protection against SARS-CoV-2.Area covered: Current understanding and advances in DNA vaccines toward COVID-19, especially those under various stages of clinical trials.Expert opinion: Through DNA vaccines, host cells are momentarily transformed into factories that produce proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. The host immune system detects these proteins to develop antibodies that neutralize and prevent the infection. This vaccine platform has additional benefits compared to traditional vaccination strategies like strong cellular immune response, higher safety margin, a simple production process as per cGMP norms, lack of any infectious agent, and a robust platform for large-scale production.},

Evidence-based therapy still consists of basic causal and supportive measures, while adjuvant interventions such as blood purification or targeted immunotherapy largely remain without proof of effectiveness so far. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of sepsis immune pathophysiology, to update the choice of therapeutic approaches targeting different immunological mechanisms in the course of sepsis and septic shock, and to call for a paradigm shift from the pathogen to the host response as a potentially more promising angle.},

Thanks to these data, together with the potential for generic, low-cost manufacturing processes and the completely synthetic nature, the prospects for mRNA vaccines are very promising. In addition, mRNA vaccines have the potential to streamline vaccine discovery and development, and facilitate a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases. In this review, we overview the unique attributes of mRNA vaccine approaches, review the data of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, discuss the current challenges, and highlight perspectives about the future of this promising technology.},

Both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology.

Because any protein can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process, mRNA vaccines also offer maximum flexibility with respect to development. Taken together, mRNA presents a promising vector that may well become the basis of a game-changing vaccine technology platform.

However, the willingness for vaccination is deeply influenced by several factors. So the aim of our review was to analyze the theme of vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on vaccine hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccine. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: In November 2020, we performed a search for original peer-reviewed articles in the electronic database PubMed (MEDLINE). The key search terms were "Vaccine hesitancy AND COVID-19". We searched for studies published during COVID-19 pandemic and reporting information about the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review. The percentage of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was not so high (up to 86.1\% students or 77.6\% general population); for influenza vaccine, the maximum percentage was 69\%. Several factors influenced the acceptance or refusal (ethnicity, working status, religiosity, politics, gender, age, education, income, etc.). The most given reasons to refuse vaccine were as follows: being against vaccines in general, concerns about safety/thinking that a vaccine produced in a rush is too dangerous, considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless nature of COVID-19, general lack of trust, doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine, belief to be already immunized, doubt about the provenience of vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The high vaccine hesitancy, also during COVID-19 pandemic, represents an important problem, and further efforts should be done to support people and give them correct information about vaccines.},

It was then rapidly expanded as a key pathway in the regulation of tissue development, regeneration, and cancer pathogenesis. The increasing amount of evidence in recent years has also connected this pathway to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Notably, the Hippo pathway has been revealed to play a pivotal role in adaptive immune cell lineages, as represented by the patients with T- and B-cell lymphopenia exhibiting defective expressions of the pathway component. The complex regulatory mechanisms of and by the Hippo pathway have also been evident as alternative signal transductions are employed in some immune cell types. In this review article, we summarize the current understanding of the emerging roles of the Hippo pathway in adaptive immune cell development and differentiation. We also highlight the recent findings concerning the dual functions of the Hippo pathway in autoimmunity and anti-cancer immune responses and discuss the key open questions in the interplay between the Hippo pathway and the mammalian immune system.},

  abstract = {The development of a protective vaccine remains a top priority for the control of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Here, we show that a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine co-expressing membrane-anchored HIV-1 envelope (Env) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag proteins to generate virus-like particles (VLPs) induces antibodies capable of broad neutralization and reduces the risk of infection in rhesus macaques. In mice, immunization with co-formulated env and gag mRNAs was superior to env mRNA alone in inducing neutralizing antibodies. Macaques were primed with a transmitted-founder clade-B env mRNA lacking the N276 glycan, followed by multiple booster immunizations with glycan-repaired autologous and subsequently bivalent heterologous envs (clades A and C). This regimen was highly immunogenic and elicited neutralizing antibodies against the most prevalent (tier-2) HIV-1 strains accompanied by robust anti-Env CD4+ T\,cell responses. Vaccinated animals had a 79\% per-exposure risk reduction upon repeated low-dose mucosal challenges with heterologous tier-2 simian\textendash human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV\,AD8). Thus, the multiclade env\textendash gag VLP mRNA platform represents a promising approach for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine.},
